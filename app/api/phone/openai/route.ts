/**
 * OpenAI's webhooks for this project, public at api.bops.bot/hooks/openai (the Fly relay in edge/
 * forwards only this path and the AgentPhone one, over the tailnet). Every delivery's signature is checked with
 * OPENAI_WEBHOOK_SECRET; anything else is turned away. `live.transport.incoming`: someone is calling
 * a bot's number (lib/server/phone.ts answers it).
 *
 * Signed in with Orgo, OpenAI delivers to Bops Cloud instead, which checks the signature and replays
 * the delivery here over its tunnel, with the token only this server knows
 * (lib/server/cloud-tunnel.ts): that request counts as checked, and so does who's calling, which the
 * cloud decided (CLOUD_CALLER_HEADER). Dormant while numbers send calls to their agents instead.
