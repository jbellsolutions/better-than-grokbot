/**
 * Phone numbers for Bops (AgentPhone), for texting and calling from any phone.
 *
 * - **One number per workspace** (the product model): it belongs to the workspace's main bot (its
 *   coordinator, e.g. Sam). People always text that number; the main bot keeps the conversation,
 *   does what it can, hands specialist work to the right bot, and the replies, results and failures
 *   go back from that same number. Specialists have no numbers of their own.
 *   `Workspace.line` holds it (number, the AgentPhone agent it's attached to, which account, and the
 *   agent it came from, for rollback). `assignWorkspaceLine` moves an existing number onto a Bops
 *   agent whose webhook is Bops; `releaseWorkspaceLine` puts it back.
 * - A bot can also have a number of its own (`Bot.phoneLine`, SMS, in the Bops sub-account): the
 *   earlier per-bot model, kept as a fallback.
 *
 * - **Numbers** live in the "Bops" AgentPhone sub-account (AGENTPHONE_SUB_ACCOUNT), apart from the user's
 *   other agents. Each bot has an AgentPhone agent with its number attached; the number carries
 *   `externalId` bops-<install>-<bot>, so it's found again.
 * - **Texts** come in on AgentPhone's webhook (api.bops.bot/hooks/agentphone, through the Fly relay,
 *   signed). One from the user's own number is the user talking: it goes into the bot's chat as their
 *   message and the bot's answer goes back by text. Anyone else's is dropped (STOP, START and HELP
 *   still get the reply carriers require).
 * - **Calls** go to the number's AgentPhone agent (voice mode "webhook"; every number Bops makes or
 *   assigns has its calls routed there, and lineUpkeep puts back one that isn't). AgentPhone hears the
 *   caller and sends each turn to the same webhook; phone-voice.ts answers it as the bot: the owner
 *   gets the whole bot (work goes through `delegate()`, as on a call in the app), anyone else a bot
 *   that only takes a message. The GPT-Live path over a SIP trunk (incomingCall, below) is kept for a
 *   number someone routes to a trunk by hand.
 * - **Who the user is:** the numbers they verified with a texted code in Settings, and, on Bops
 *   Cloud, whoever the cloud says owns the line (bops.phone_lines: the first phone to call or text a
 *   new number in its 15 minutes; phone-lines.ts). On Bops Cloud the cloud decides it for every call
 *   and text and this Mac follows (CallerVerdict).
 * - **On Bops Cloud** (signed in with Orgo; lib/server/cloud.ts) AgentPhone is reached through the
 *   cloud, always in the user's own sub-account. Both webhooks arrive at the cloud, which checks them
 *   and passes them to this Mac over its tunnel (lib/server/cloud-tunnel.ts), and the cloud answers
 *   calls while the Mac is away (cloudCall, below).
