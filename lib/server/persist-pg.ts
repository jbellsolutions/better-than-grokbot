/**
 * Hosted Bops keeps each user's state in Postgres: one row per Orgo user in bops.app_state (see
 * db/), the whole AppState as JSONB. A server process holds one user's state in memory at a time,
 * the same as the desktop app: pinned with BOPS_ORGO_USER_ID, or whoever signs in.
 *
 * - The user's row is loaded into memory before the first request (instrumentation.ts) when the
 *   server is pinned, and otherwise at sign-in, before signIn() returns (switchTo). A sign-out
 *   saves the user's state and clears it from memory, so the next person to sign in never sees it.
 * - Changes are written behind, at most every SAVE_MS, guarded by the row's version: a write only
 *   lands on the version it was loaded at. If another server wrote the row in between, nothing is
 *   overwritten: this server takes the newer row and drops its own unsaved changes (logged).
 * - If the database is down, the state in memory keeps serving and the save is retried with
 *   backoff. Nothing is written for a user whose row hasn't been read yet, so a server that
 *   started while the database was down can't overwrite the saved state with a fresh one.
