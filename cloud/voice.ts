/**
 * A call's turns, answered in the cloud while the Mac is away (asleep, off, offline, or not answering
 * in time). Every Bops number's calls go to its AgentPhone agent in voice mode "webhook": AgentPhone
 * hears the caller and sends each turn to /hooks/agentphone (hooks.ts), and the text answered is
 * what it speaks. The Mac answers them when it's there (lib/server/phone-voice.ts); this is the
 * cloud's own answer. Owner: edge builder.
 *
 * - The owner (bops.phone_lines says so: lines.ts, never the uploaded state) gets their bot, from the
 *   last state upload: it says the computer it works on is offline, takes a note of anything they
 *   want done, and says goodbye. Its apps and where it's in Slack, Telegram and Discord are known,
 *   as on a GPT-Live call in the cloud (calls.ts frontPrompt).
 * - Anyone else gets a friendly bot that only chats and takes a message for the person it works for:
 *   it's told nothing about them, so it can't share anything.
 * - Each turn is one OpenAI Responses call (a fast model, low reasoning, two tools: take_message and
 *   end_call, each with the words to say), its tokens counted (recordTokens, source "phone").
 * - A call is grouped by AgentPhone's callId and ends on a hangup, on AgentPhone's call_ended event,
 *   after 2 minutes without a turn, or at 10 minutes. Then the Mac gets it as a "call" event (kept
 *   until it's back): the transcript, any message, whether it was the owner. Its minutes are counted.
 *   Calls live in this process's memory: a restart mid-call loses that call's record.
